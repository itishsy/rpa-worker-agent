# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**RPA Worker Agent** is a .NET 8 Windows service that orchestrates VMware Workstation VMs running RPA execution environments. It manages multi-VM pools with profile-based snapshot switching, coordinates with a cloud scheduler backend, and maintains local state via SQLite.

**Core Domain:**
- `profileId`: Task scheduling dimension assigned by cloud backend
- `workerId`: VM-local runner instance identity (unique across host)
- `snapshotName`: Revertible VM environment state
- One host → multiple VMs → multiple profiles/snapshots per VM

## Build & Test Commands

Set environment variables before running dotnet commands (required for isolated environments):

```powershell
$env:DOTNET_CLI_HOME = (Resolve-Path -LiteralPath '.').Path
$env:APPDATA = Join-Path (Resolve-Path -LiteralPath '.').Path '.dotnet-appdata'
$env:DOTNET_SKIP_FIRST_TIME_EXPERIENCE = '1'
```

```powershell
# Build
dotnet build rpa-worker-agent/rpa-worker-agent.csproj

# Run all tests (88 smoke tests, no test framework dependency)
dotnet run --project rpa-worker-agent/tests/Seebot.WorkerAgent.Tests/Seebot.WorkerAgent.Tests.csproj
```

There is no separate "run single test" mechanism — the test runner is a custom smoke test harness in `tests/Seebot.WorkerAgent.Tests/Program.cs`. To isolate a test, comment out others or add a filter by test name inside that file.

### Execution Flow

**Startup:**
1. Validate configuration (`WorkerAgentOptionsValidator`)
2. Validate VM snapshots exist (`StartupValidator`)
3. Report host capabilities to cloud backend
4. Initialize SQLite at `{AppContext.BaseDirectory}/data/agent.db`

**Main Scheduling Cycle (`PoolSchedulerService.RunOneCycleAsync`):**
1. Query pending tasks by profileId from cloud backend
2. Load current VM states from SQLite
3. Report VM status to cloud backend
4. Find a compatible idle VM candidate for each pending profile
5. Trigger at most 1 VM switch per cycle

**VM Switch Orchestration (`VmSwitchService.SwitchAsync`):**

Transaction states (in order):
`CREATED → STOP_RUNNER_DONE → LOG_BACKUP_DONE → VM_STOP_DONE → SNAPSHOT_REVERT_DONE → VM_START_DONE → WORKER_READY_DONE → SUCCESS / FAILED / NEED_MANUAL_CHECK`

Steps:
1. Check runner status via GuestWorkerClient (HTTP :9090)
2. Kill runner if not already stopped
3. Backup VM directories (`cache/db/file/logs`) to `{HostWorkPath}/{VmName}/{timestamp}/`
4. `vmrun stop` (soft, then hard after timeout)
5. `vmrun revertToSnapshot`
6. `vmrun start nogui`
7. Poll until runner is Runnable/Running; verify workerId/profileId
8. Report result to cloud backend

### Key Domain Concepts

**RunnerStatusCode enum** (from `Core/Domain/RunnerStatusCode.cs`):
```
New=0, Runnable=1, Running=2, Closed=3, RobotError=4,
ClientError=5, Upgrading=6, UpgradeFailed=7, Offline=8
```

**Switch candidate rules** (from `WorkerStateEvaluator`):
- VM must support the target profile
- Must be Runnable (not Running/Upgrading)
- Idle for ≥ `IdleStableSeconds`
- Current profile's task queue must be empty
- Not quarantined, no active switch transaction

**SQLite tables** (from `Core/Storage/LocalStore.cs`):
- `local_vm_state`: per-VM runtime state (runner code, profile, idle time, quarantine flag)
- `local_switch_transaction`: full switch lifecycle tracking

### HTTP Clients

| Client | Target | Port |
|--------|--------|------|
| `GuestWorkerClient` | In-VM runner status/kill | 9090 (enforced by validator) |
| `SchedulerClient` | Cloud backend API | Configured via `Scheduler:BaseUrl` |

### Test Approach

Tests use a custom in-process `Assert` class (no xUnit/NUnit). Each test is a named action registered in Program.cs. Fakes are hand-rolled (no Moq/AutoFixture). Tests cover all 14 P0 development phases end-to-end.

## Configuration

Configuration comes from `appsettings.json`. Key sections:

```json
{
  "Agent": {
    "HostId": "",
    "PollIntervalSeconds": 30,
    "IdleStableSeconds": 60,
    "MaxSwitchesPerCycle": 1,
    "ForceRevertWhenBackupFailed": false
  },
  "Scheduler": { "BaseUrl": "", "AccessToken": "" },
  "Vmrun": { "VmrunPath": "", "DefaultStartNoGui": true },
  "VirtualMachines": [{
    "Name": "", "VmxPath": "", "WorkerId": "",
    "RunnerStatusUrl": "http://...:9090/...",
    "RunnerKillUrl": "http://...:9090/...",
    "Profiles": [{ "ProfileId": "", "SnapshotName": "" }]
  }]
}
```

Constraints enforced at startup:
- `RunnerStatusUrl` and `RunnerKillUrl` must use port 9090
- `WorkerId` must be unique across all VMs on the host
- `ProfileId` must be unique within each VM
- `GuestBackupPaths` must define all four paths: Cache, Db, File, Logs
